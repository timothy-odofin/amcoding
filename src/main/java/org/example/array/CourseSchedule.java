/**
 * There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1. You are given an array prerequisites where prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.
 *
 *     For example, the pair [0, 1], indicates that to take course 0 you have to first take course 1.
 *
 * Return true if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return false.
 *
 * Â 
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 * To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 * To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
